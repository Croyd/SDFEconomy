Language Conversion
-------------------

To convert a native encoded Russian translation to a format Java can use:

native2ascii -encoding windows-1251 CommandTranslation_ru.properties.orig CommandTranslation_ru.properties


Known caveats
-------------
* ChestShop through Vault checks the last location of an offline player or current
  location of an online player to see if they have enough money to buy items instead 
  of directly using the location of the shop.
